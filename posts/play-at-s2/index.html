There is no time or incentive to explore in school — you’re worried about your next assignment or exam, and want to get the best grade that you can. At work, you have an instrumental purpose — making your company money, publishing papers, etc. Hackathons used to be a place for play, but they&rsquo;ve <a href="https://jzhao.xyz/posts/hackathons/?ref=home">turned into corporate events</a>.</p><p>Side projects can be great for play, but they often take a backseat to school or work. Moreover, there are rarely things in our physical environment that remind us to play<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> and it’s difficult to find a community to play with.</p><p><a href=https://school2point0.com>School 2.0</a> — a 26-person group house we ran in New Mexico — was filled with play. We turned the kitchen into a museum of pasta-stick constellations and random objects hanging from the ceiling. Marley, Noah, and Vincent woke up one day, confused about shapes. Why are certain shapes more aesthetically pleasing than others? Somehow this led to them making a neural network that generated new shapes.</p><figure><img src=https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_5113A39C96528DE120DCBFBB56CDF0687ED8A5D778619B8407A209BB835AF7CF_1653058262721_img_20201118_022851.jpg width=300px><figcaption style=text-align:center>Kitchen shenanigans</figcaption></figure><p>Geffen and Steve wondered what it would be like to live in a flying house, so they made renders of flying houses. Will was thinking about what his <a href=https://www.welcometothecosmos.com/post/History%20of%20Life>great great great great great great&mldr; 200 more great&mldr; grandfather was like</a>, so he wrote a blog post about it. We made an “extremely serious” page of <a href=https://bio.school2point0.com/>bios of everyone at School 2.0</a>. There are endless examples.</p><div class=row style=display:flex><div class=col style=flex:50%;padding:5px><figure><img src=/play-at-s2/flyinghouse.gif style=height:200px><figcaption style=text-align:center>Flying house</figcaption></div></figure><div class=col style=flex:33%;padding:5px><figure><img src=https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_5CAE4584F2CAAA72828D3A17EECDCAA7711159F0F4B53F18980C106180F63D18_1636691026629_shapes.png style=height:200px><figcaption style=text-align:center>A shape generated by a neural network</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Why was there so much play? We had demos every week, which showed people what play looked like. Our physical environment reminded us to play: we were surrounded by horses you could feed whenever you wanted, mountains you can climb, whiteboards everywhere. There was also great self-selection. It took a high level of openness and willingness to adventure to come to the middle of New Mexico with 25 strangers during a pandemic.</p><p>Typical inhibitors of play were not present. There was no status at School 2.0, so you didn&rsquo;t need to impress people with your fancy companies.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> There were no corporate sponsors who told you to build serious stuff.</p><p>Most importantly, Marley and I valued play, and communities have a way of trickling its founders’ values down to the whole community.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Twitter might be an exception in the digital world.
