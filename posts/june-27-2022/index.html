<a href=https://curius.app target=_blank>Curius</a>.</em></p><p>1. I wish bad feelings had a dismiss option. For example, I know I need to pee, and I’m doing everything in my power to get to a washroom as soon as possible. But I don’t need to feel like my bladder is exploding; I just want to hit &ldquo;dismiss&rdquo;.</p><p>2. What makes Less Wrong different from Reddit? Is it the title? Is it the subtle design differences? My hypothesis is that how the communities were seeded is important. If Twitter/Instagram/etc. were seeded differently, would they still have converged to the same product that they are today?</p><p>3. Conversations that go deep on one topic are much better than ones that spend a lot of time exploring topics superficially.</p><p>4. In school, you’re incentivized to learn just enough to do well on your exams. Deeper understanding is not incentivized.</p><p>5. Capillaries act as water coolers in the brain.</p><p>6. A friend said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always confused!&rdquo; I thought that was amazing.</p><p>7. I find myself often thinking about how other people think about me. For example, I wanted to read a book, and my mind thought about sitting in a place where people could see me — so they think I’m cool. I hate how my mind thinks about this.</p><p>8. I feel misunderstood by my parents. They think I spent the past year doing nothing. I don&rsquo;t blame them — what I&rsquo;m doing isn&rsquo;t very legible to most people. But if I renamed the time I spent on Curius to &ldquo;Google internship&rdquo;, the summer I spent on the low-cost brain scanner to &ldquo;Neuralink internship&rdquo;, and the past few months I spent reading neurotech papers to &ldquo;MIT PhD&rdquo;, they definitely wouldn’t be saying that. We lack language to describe and legitimize independent explorations.</p><p>9. Akward silence is great!</p><p>10. Being shy has unexpected benefits. I rarely post on social media websites which makes me less addicted to them. I don’t enjoy parties which makes me spend my time with people 1-on-1.</p><p>11. How do the number of bathrooms you need in a house scale with the number of residents? Is sharing 1 bathroom with 4 people worse than sharing 2 bathrooms with 9 people? (My answer will be revealed in the next post.)</p><p>12. Suppose you can record from all the 100 billion neurons in the human brain. What do you do next?</p><p><em>This post was harder to write than usual because some points felt quite personal (7 & 8). At first, I didn&rsquo;t want to share it publicly &ndash; but if there is some chance the post encourages others to be more vulnerable and honest in public, it seems good!</em></p></div><div class=post-tags></div></div><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-K86BSP87HE"></script>
