I am currently a research fellow at the [Cohen Lab](https://cohenweb.rc.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. My goal is to build magical brain computer interfaces for humanity.

I'm most proud of the communities I helped build, like [School 2.0](https://school2point0.com) — a 26-person group house in New Mexico. [Marley](https://marleyx.com), [Aayush](https://aayushg.com/), and I recently started a group house in Cambridge, MA — message me if you're in town and need a free place to stay or want to come for Sunday dinner!

In the past, I studied math, computer science, and a touch of physics and neuroscience at McGill. In the past past, I loved taking part in science fairs and won 2nd place in Physics at ISEF.
