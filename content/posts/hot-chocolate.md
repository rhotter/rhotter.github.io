This list isn't for you if you don't like dark and thick hot chocolate.

### Montreal
* Au Festin de Babette (Le Belge is my favourite)
* Patrice Patissier

### Toronto
* Soma Chocolatemaker (order drinking chocolate; the non-drinking chocolate tastes like hot milk)

### New York
* LA Burdick
* Jacques Torres

### Boston
* LA Burdick

### Taos
* Chokola (best hot chocolate I've had in North America)

### San Francisco Bay Area
* Dandelion Chocolate (order drinking chocolate if you're brave)
* Cafe Venetia
