1. How would you like the world to look like in 200 years?
2. What makes you happy?
3. What were the inflection points in your childhood?
4. What have you been thinking about?

That said, I think people worry too much about initial questions. The important questions are the follow up questions.

Another approach to getting to know someone is to think about a problem with them.

_Update (Feb 25, 2022):_ I removed two questions, which I now only ask good friends:

- What is your happiness percentile relative to the past 5 years?[^1]
- When was the last time you were sad?

[^1]: I prefer this to "How are you?"
