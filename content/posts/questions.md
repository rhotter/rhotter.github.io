1. How would you like the world to look like in 200 years?
2. What is your happiness percentile relative to the past 5 years? I prefer this to "How are you?"
3. What makes you happy?
4. What were the inflection points in your childhood?
5. When was the last time you were sad?
6. What have you been thinking about?

That said, I think people worry too much about initial questions. The important questions are the follow up questions.

Another approach to getting to know someone is to think about a problem with them.
